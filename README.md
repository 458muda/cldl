## Deep Learning for mapping Pond aquaculture and mangrove ecosystems

A project supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Oceans and Seafood Markets Initiative.

Goal: To create land cover and land change maps of pond agriculture and coastal habitats in selected countries within the global tropics. It was part of the process to create a Sustainability certification for farms under the aquaculture stewardship council ASC by providing data to uphold the rules set by the Ramsar convention on wetlands.

With the growing population, food production needs to increase by 70% by 2050. This is expected to lead to rapid growth in shrimp aquaculture in brackish coastal areas. Such expansion could have a significant environmental impact on mangroves, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and fish nurseries. 

Land cover and land change maps were developed using Landsat imagery which can be viewed on an interactive web-based map that shows changes over time.
